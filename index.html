  <!--Body Paragraphs-->
      <h3>Helpful Work Experience:</h3>
        <p>During my time at Columbia Sportswear, I’ve not only developed strong interpersonal skills which are necessary in this type of research as one might need it to obtain information through speaking with and interviewing others, but I’ve also learned a great deal of research techniques as well. For example, when I was promoted to visual supervisor over the summer, I was in charge of identifying customer buying patterns and placing product accordingly. By placing a fleece sweater for example, in the front of the store, we saw them sell a lot faster than when we hung them and placed them in the center of the store. We would obtain this type of quantitative sales data, implement it into back-of-house information software and learn every products best placement by trial and error of this technique.</p>
      <h4>Degree Experience:</h4>
	 <p>Technical writing is a confusing field for many people because the classes we take vary from editing skills all the way to usability lab research. It’s so broad that we students get the opportunity to choose what path we want to take in the degree. For the students that want to be more of a traditional technical writer, they might take more grant writing courses to learn how to write professionally and how to articulate complex material to a general audience. For people like myself on the other hand, with the degree, I choose to take a non-traditional approach. I took courses like writing with digital technology where I learned how to code websites using HTML from scratch. I also took a usability course where I learned how to spot user reactions to website designs, take that information and apply it to bettering the website in order to accomplish the best user expierence.</p>
       <p>However, I have a unique part of my background that only 10 people at the entire University of Minnesota have- a emphasis in legal discourse and public policy. Now, many people don’t even bat an eyelash at the idea of an emphasis, in fact, a lot of people would roll their eyes at them. But in my case, this emphasis in legal discourse and public policy helped me develop extremely strong critical thinking skills that a lot of students that took an emphasis in say, IT and design or environmental studies, simply don’t have. If I were to be going for a career in UX Design, maybe this emphasis wouldn’t be as useful and the person with the IT and design emphasis would be more equipped. For UX research on the other hand, having a strong sense of critical thinking is a pivotal part of being good at the job and my education in reading law has helped me develop the and perfect this very skill.
